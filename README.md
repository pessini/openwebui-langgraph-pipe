# Open WebUI ↔ LangGraph Pipe (Human-in-the-Loop)

This project demonstrates how to integrate [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui) with [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) using a custom **Pipe function**.  
Unlike basic integrations, this implementation includes **human-in-the-loop features** such as:

- ✅ Real-time streaming of messages  
- ✅ Handling agent interrupts and resuming with user input  
- ✅ Status events for better user feedback  
- ✅ Optional debug logging and tool call visibility  

With this setup, Open WebUI becomes a powerful interface for experimenting with **interactive, controllable AI agents** built on LangGraph.
